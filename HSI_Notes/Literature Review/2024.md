(NO ACCESS)
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has become a crucial tool in geological mapping and mineral exploration, but its complexity and high dimensionality present significant processing challenges. Techniques such as signal-to-noise ratio estimation, dimensionality reduction, and endmember extraction are essential for handling hyperspectral data, though these often require customization due to environmental variability. Recent advances in AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have shown great promise in overcoming these challenges, enabling more accurate mineral classification and mapping in remote areas. The increasing availability of advanced hyperspectral satellite sensors has spurred a surge in research, with over 1,000 studies in the past six years, though the full potential of AI techniques remains underexplored, signaling exciting opportunities for future research in hyperspectral lithological mapping.

Abstract
- **Objective**: Use hyperspectral imaging for real-time ore-waste analysis of drill cuttings in an open pit gold mine.
- **Sample Collection**: Drill cuttings collected at regular depth intervals from 5 blast holes.
- **Processing Methods**:
    1. **Knowledge-based**: Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) to estimate ore grade.
    2. **Data-driven**: Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) for ore-waste classification.
- **Results**: Both LSU and GBC showed accurate results compared to XRD and gold assay analysis.
- **Benefits**: Enhances grade control, reduces costs, saves time, minimizes uncertainty, and improves ore-waste boundary precision in resource block models.

**Objective**

- Develop a machine learning model to classify ore and waste samples using hyperspectral data.

**Dataset Overview**

- Initial dataset consisted of **49 trays** of borehole samples, deemed insufficient for effective ML training.

**Data Augmentation Strategy**

- Each tray split into **four parts**, creating **196 samples** for analysis.
- **Avoided split bias** by ensuring all parts of a tray remained together in either training or testing datasets.

**Dataset Partitioning**

- **Training Dataset**: 70% of samples (33 trays, 132 parts).
- **Testing Dataset**: 30% of samples (16 trays, 64 parts).
- Representative samples included from both **ore** and **waste** classes.

**Test Dataset Selection**

- **BH188**: Spatially distant borehole for unique data perspectives.
- **BH156**: Borehole with higher-grade samples for variation.

**Methodology**

- Proposed a novel **absorption-peak-based feature extraction** approach instead of using traditional pixel-based classification.
- Utilized **First Derivative Analysis** to identify absorption peaks and **Second Derivative Analysis** to streamline data.
- Set a **reflectance value threshold** (0.95) to filter reliable absorption peaks for further analysis.

**Modeling Approaches**

- **Logistic Support Vector Machine (LSU)** and **Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)** were implemented for classification.
- GBC was specifically used to differentiate between ore and waste samples, achieving high performance metrics.

**Performance Metrics**

- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, highlighting effectiveness in ore vs. waste classification.
- GBC achieved **perfect precision** for ore and high recall, ensuring minimal misclassification of valuable ore as waste.

**Conclusions**

- The study effectively increased dataset size while ensuring quality through thoughtful sample selection and preparation.
- The combination of LSU and GBC demonstrated robust classification capabilities, validating the proposed feature extraction method and data augmentation strategy.

#### Hyperspectral imaging for mineral composition and weathering recognition of rock slope on the reservoir bank
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10064-024-03694-x

(NO ACCESS)

Abstract
**Background**

- The mineral composition and weathering (the process of breaking down rocks) of the **hydro-fluctuation belt** (an area along reservoir banks that changes with water levels) are influenced by how water interacts with rocks.
- Traditional methods used to identify minerals and assess weathering have limitations, and there aren’t consistent ways to measure weathering on rock slopes near reservoirs.

**Objective**

- This study uses a **hyperspectral imaging technique**. This advanced technology is good at observing chemical changes on surfaces to evaluate weathering in the hydro-fluctuation belt.

**Methods**

- The researchers combined hyperspectral images with a method called **Spectral Angle Mapping** to classify different minerals present in the rocks.
- They developed a **weathering evaluation system** using the **Random Forest classification model**. This model uses a specific **weathering index** to connect mineral changes with the degree of weathering.

**Findings**

- As water interacts with rocks in the hydro-fluctuation belt, certain changes occur:
    - The amount of **carbonate minerals** (like limestone) decreases.
    - The amount of **clay minerals** (like those found in soil) increases.
- The mineral content is also influenced by factors such as how long the rocks have been exposed to water, how damaged the rock is, and how much erosion has occurred.

**Conclusion**

- The weathering index (a measure of how weathered the rocks are) is positively related to the weathering degree. This means that as the weathering degree increases, the index also goes up, reflecting the changes in minerals and rock damage.
- Using hyperspectral imaging to recognize minerals and assess weathering offers a **quick, non-contact, and quantitative** way to evaluate mineral content and weathering on reservoir banks. This improves how efficiently minerals can be detected and weathering evaluated in these areas.



### Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Random Occlusion Data Augmentation

**Random Occlusion Data Augmentation** is a technique used to make models more robust by simulating missing parts or occlusions in the data. The method involves "hiding" or "masking out" random parts of an image during training, so the model learns to focus on all parts of the image rather than relying too heavily on specific details that might not always be visible in real-world data.

**How It Works**

In random occlusion:

1. **Random Masking**: Small patches (rectangles or other shapes) are randomly "blacked out" or "grayed out" in an image. The information within these masked areas is hidden, which is called an occlusion.
2. **Multiple Variations**: This process is applied to many images in the training dataset, so each image may have different parts blocked out in each version.
3. **Encourages Robustness**: Since the model is trained on images with some missing information, it learns to identify and rely on other parts of the image that are still visible. This helps the model become more flexible and less dependent on a specific feature in a certain location.

**Why It’s Useful**

In hyperspectral imaging, random occlusion helps the model deal with real-world situations where parts of the image might be obscured due to shadows, noise, or environmental factors. By "teaching" the model that some areas might be missing, it becomes better at focusing on all available parts of the image, improving its ability to classify correctly even with partial or obstructed views.
